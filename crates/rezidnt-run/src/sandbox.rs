//! Sandbox substrate seam (C3a — DR-025; design `permit-sole-chokepoint-c3.md`
//! §5). The `SandboxSubstrate` (I4) wraps the S1 spawn seam so the daemon-owned
//! harness process runs CONFINED — making the deterministic permit verdict
//! (`PathConfinement`, a `PathScope` sibling in `rezidnt-gate`) UNBYPASSABLE.
//!
//! This module is the ORACLE SEAM ONLY: the trait + the policy shape + the
//! availability probe the tests drive against. The Linux `bwrap` implementation
//! (`--ro-bind`/`--bind` the folded binds, `--unshare-all`, `--die-with-parent`,
//! the daemon keeps the PTY) is the IMPLEMENTER's next job — every method below
//! is `todo!()`-stubbed so the C3a board is assert-red, not compile-red, exactly
//! as the S4 gate skeleton was.
//!
//! ## The load-bearing shape (DR-025 §Decision, the C6 escalation lesson)
//!
//! [`SandboxPolicy`] is the confinement authority. Its `binds` field is PRIVATE
//! and settable ONLY through [`SandboxPolicy::from_folded_authority`] — there is
//! deliberately NO constructor that takes a bind from a [`SpawnPlan`] arg, an
//! env var, or any run-supplied value. This is the DR-024/DR-016 privilege-
//! escalation guard expressed in the type system: an input that WIDENS
//! confinement must come from folded authority, or the sandbox is escapable-by-
//! argument (design §5, §8.3). Criterion 3's test drives exactly this seam.
